# StreetMesh

*StreetMesh* is a public framework for spatially organizing the web, building upon open standards and existing protocols. This repository documents this framework.

## The Dream

I dream of a virtual world where people can live active, productive lives full of wonder and community. This *metaverse* translates the information systems we have today into richly visual environments: websites of all kinds can make their homes here.

Like the real world and the web, my virtual world is *spatialized*: it is a vast, interconnected place that can be explored, in which areas of interest have permanent locations, businesses can have stores, and people can have domiciles.

Life happens here. People make new connections in my virtual world. They play games, start movements and businesses, and even fall in love. People study the real world using sophisticated virtual tools for visualization and analysis. People earn degrees here.

Commerce happens here. Stores in my virtual world pull their inventory directly from e-commerce websites. I can purchase virtual goods here and store them in my domicile, as well as order material goods and have them shipped to my home.

Events happen here. People gather in my virtual world to celebrate all matters of social and cultural importance. Community is built here. Real-life events are streamed to my virtual world, allowing their organizers to reach new and far-flung audiences.

This is not a product, but a platform. It belongs to no one and everyone. Built on the web’s existing foundation, it invites creators, thinkers, builders, and dreamers to shape it freely. 

My virtual world is not just the next version of the internet—it's the spatial web. It's the StreetMesh.

## The Name

The name StreetMesh is inspired by Neal Stephenson's book *Snow Crash*:

> The Street in *Snow Crash* is the backbone of the Metaverse—a single, grand boulevard that stretches for thousands of kilometers in virtual space. It’s a shared, persistent environment where avatars walk, talk, trade, and interact. Created and maintained by the Global Multimedia Protocol Group, The Street is lined with buildings, parks, shops, and clubs built by users, corporations, and developers, each parceling out space like digital real estate. Everything in the Metaverse revolves around The Street—it’s the main artery of virtual life, a 3D manifestation of the internet where social status is coded into the fidelity of your avatar and the size of your domain. Whether you’re a hacker, a mogul, or a wanderer, The Street is where you show up, plug in, and take part in the digital sprawl.
